# Evolution
Base Framework

I'm constantly copying and pasting HTML and CSS from other projects when I start something new, but not anymore. I'm finally going to sort my own base out. If other people use it, winner winner chicken dinner but it is essentially just my way of starting  afresh each time with something that works.

Plus it's a good way of trying out stuff innit :)
